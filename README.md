# ramipril-asi-effect

This program is designed to predict the effectiveness of Ramipril, a drug used as an ACE inhibitor to treat high blood pressure. It uses simulated data to represent Ramipril’s properties, like its molecular weight and binding efficiency. The goal is to predict a target value called "Standard Value," which can indicate how well Ramipril inhibits ACE activity.

Data Preparation: The program generates sample data for Ramipril, including features like its molecular weight and other chemical properties that affect its performance as an ACE inhibitor.

Target Property Prediction: The "Standard Value" (e.g., IC50) is used as the target. This value shows how effective Ramipril is in blocking ACE, which is crucial for lowering blood pressure.

Handling Missing Values: The program introduces some missing values to mimic real-world scenarios, then fills these gaps to ensure complete data for analysis.

Model Training and Tuning: It trains a Random Forest model to find relationships between Ramipril’s properties and its effectiveness. The model is fine-tuned using different settings to get the best possible prediction accuracy.

Evaluating the Model: It checks how good the predictions are by comparing them with true values. If the predicted and actual values match closely, it means the model is good at understanding Ramipril’s effectiveness.

Visualization and Insights: The program plots graphs to show which properties of Ramipril are most influential and how accurate the model's predictions are.

Overall, this program provides a way to predict how well Ramipril performs as an ACE inhibitor, helping in drug research and development.
