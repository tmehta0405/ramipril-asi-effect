    "What It Is: The amount of Ramipril needed to reduce the activity of ACE by half.\n",
    "Simple Explanation: Imagine you want to reduce the activity of a machine by 50%. IC50 tells you how much of Ramipril you need to add to make that happen. If you need \n",

    "\n",
    "# EC50 (Half-Maximal Effective Concentration)\n",
    "What It Is: The amount of Ramipril needed to achieve half of its maximum effect.\n",
